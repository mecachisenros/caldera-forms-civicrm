# Data fields

There are a couple  of options to be aware of when syncing data to CiviCRM. This plugin adds two Special Field Types and integrates the Select Bulk/Insert to Custom Fields created in CiviCRM

## Special fields

When adding new fields to your Caldera form there are two new options available in the Special field type:

* CiviCRM Country
* CiviCRM State/Provice

Similar to using a Profile form in CiviCRM, the Country field should be place prior to the State/Provide field so the correct options are displayed.

The default Country and State/Province used in the field will be taken from the settings in **Administer > Localization > Languages, Currency, Locations**

## Custom Data with Select fields

You can create custom fields in CiviCRM that are:

* Dropdown Select
* Checkbox
* Radio
* Date Picker

And have then select those options when you setup your Caldera Form. Start by adding a new field to the form and giving it a name. Then scroll down to the Bulk Insert/Preset option and select the field creating in CiviCRM you want to use and click Insert Options.

When using the Date Picker you must use the same settings that are in **Administer > Localization > Date Formats** in the **Date Input Fields** section. And adjusted by customized in **Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Date Preferences**
